  "summary": "I’m a Senior Full-Stack and Mobile Developer with over 9 years of experience turning complex ideas into fast, reliable, and user-friendly products.I build for both web and mobile, blending strong front-end experiences with clean, scalable back-end systems. My main tools are React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, Angular, and Laravel, and I’m always focused on performance, clean architecture, and great UX. Over the years, I’ve led and delivered projects across e-commerce, ERP, and enterprise-level platforms. I care deeply about details — from pixel-perfect UI to smooth API integration and secure authentication systems. I love working with teams that care about quality, clear communication, and building products people actually enjoy using.
